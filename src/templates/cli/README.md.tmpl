{{ description }}

Built on the lacodda line's stack for command-line tools: Rust, clap, anyhow.
Scaffolded with [lyrn](https://github.com/lacodda/lyrn).

## Install

```console
$ cargo install {{ name }}
```

Or without a package manager:

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{ repo }}/main/tools/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{ repo }}/main/tools/install.ps1 | iex
```

## A day in the life

```console
$ {{ name }} hello
Hello, world!
```

## Developing

```console
$ cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

That is the same gate CI runs, so a green terminal means a green pull request.
