# ADR 0002: Dependabot is off on purpose

- Status: accepted
- Date: {{ date }}

## Context

GitHub offers Dependabot on every repository: a pull request for each new
version of each dependency, and another for each security advisory against
one. On a project with one or two maintainers that hands the rhythm of updates
to the bot - a dozen small pull requests a week, each with a CI run of its own,
each merged on the strength of a green check rather than a reading of what
changed, and a major version arriving as one more of them.

Its two halves do different jobs, though. Version updates are housekeeping and
can wait for a day that suits the project. A vulnerability cannot.

## Decision

No Dependabot version updates: no `.github/dependabot.yml`. Dependencies are
updated by hand, all at once, at most once a week, in a commit of their own -
majors included, and a major that breaks the build is fixed in that commit
rather than postponed by pinning the old version.

The security half is `.github/workflows/audit.yml`. It checks every push, every
pull request and every Monday morning against the published advisories, and
holds each dependency's license to the list the project accepts. A red audit is
fixed before the next release: by the update, or - when no fixed version exists
yet - by accepting the advisory in the audit's configuration with the reason
written next to it.

## Consequences

- Updates arrive in batches somebody reads, not on a bot's schedule.
- An advisory published while nothing was pushed still turns the audit red on
  the next Monday: a red run with no commit behind it means the world moved.
- Adding a `dependabot.yml` reverses this decision and is recorded as a new
  one, superseding this.
