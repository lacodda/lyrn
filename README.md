## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing lyrn, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. These are essential for running JavaScript projects and managing their dependencies.

### Installation

To install lyrn globally on your system, use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install -g lyrn
```

This allows you to use lyrn from any directory on your system.

Alternatively, for a one-off project setup without global installation, use:

```bash
npx lyrn@latest
```

### Creating Your First Project

To create a new project, lyrn streamlines the process with a simple command:

```bash
lyrn create project <your-app-name> -f <framework>
```

Replace `<your-app-name>` with the name of your project and `<framework>` with the web framework you want to use (e.g., `react`, `vue`).

## ðŸ›  Usage

After creating a project, navigate into your project directory to start development:

```bash
cd <your-app-name>
```

To launch the development server with live reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

When you're ready to build your application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To serve your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```
